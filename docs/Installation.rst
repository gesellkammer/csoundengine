.. admonition:: Linux: Installing from source

    The csound version packaged with most linux distributions is often
    too old. The best way to get csound is to install it from
    source. See `Csound's BUILD documentation <https://github.com/csound/csound/blob/develop/BUILD.md>`_
    for reference
