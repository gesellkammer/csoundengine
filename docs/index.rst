csoundengine - Documentation
============================

**csoundengine** is a library to run and control a `csound <https://csound.com>`_
process for **realtime** or **offline** sound processing.

Interaction with *csound* is through its API using
`ctypes bindings <https://csound.com/docs/ctcsound/>`_.
See the `Csound FLOSS manual <https://flossmanual.csound.com/introduction/preface>`_
to learn more about csound and its syntax and run examples online. **csoundengine**
is compatible with any recent version of csound6 (>= 6.16) and csound7
